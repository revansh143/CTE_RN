# npm resolution error report

While resolving: TestProject@0.0.1
Found: react@18.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"16.8.6" from react-native-webview-fix@1.0.10
node_modules/react-native-webview-fix
  react-native-webview-fix@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
